### What is VPC Flow Logs
VPC Flow Logs are used to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). They help with monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing network performance. Hereâ€™s a real-time example:

**Example: Security Incident Investigation**

A company had a security breach where sensitive data might have been taken. By turning on VPC Flow Logs, the security team can check the traffic patterns before, during, and after the incident.

They can analyze:

- **Source and destination IP addresses**: Identify where the suspicious traffic originated and where it was sent.
- **Traffic volume**: Determine if there was an unusual spike in data transfer at the time of the breach.
- **Protocol and port usage**: Check if uncommon protocols or ports were used during the incident.
